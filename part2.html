            <h1>Defining the functions of the concept</h1>
            <img id="p-img" src="Images/meme-2cover.png">
            <p>We are continuing from here:</p>
            <p><a href="part1.html" target="_blank">A Non-Technical & Highly Speculative Look at Memes: Part 1</a></p>
            <p>Part 1 was an introduction to the contextual sphere through which we will try to unpack meme. The brief synopsis of that essay is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>meme comes from Richard Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene as a corollary to gene but in a mental context as opposed to a biological one</li>
                <li>the term meme is multi-faceted</li>
                <li>memes transfer data (information, emotions, etc)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Cultural Definitions</h2>
            <p>The next step is to look at this term as if we were trying to place it into a dictionary.</p>
            <h3>Meme (n.)</h3>
            <img id="p-img" src="Images/meme2-img1.png">
            <p>The foundation of a meme’s noun capability is in its transfer dynamics. The meme becomes functional the moment another individual understands the context within it.</p>
            <p>Social media is a birthing ground for contextual relevance. Why type out repetitive phrases when you could send colorful images that emotes the same sentiment with more nuance and flavor?</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <img id="p-img" src="Images/meme2-img2.png">
            <p>In this segment of defining the term, the images themselves are memes. They bring context to another individual without word-language or speech.</p>
            <h3>Meme (v.)</h3>
            <img id="p-img" src="Images/meme2-img3.png">
            <p>The ‘active’ layer of meme brings a level of sovereignty to the individual and hive-mind. ‘To meme’ is to accomplish the transferring mechanic of the contextual object from one individual to the next.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <img id="p-img" src="Images/meme2-img4.png">
            <p>Here meme is an action on top of the noun definition of meme. It only occurs after the initial definition is met.</p>
            <p>To spread an object that has zero contextual relevance is like to talking to pavement in Swahili. To meme (v.) is to amplify an objects mindshare in another individual.</p>
            <p>The example above is the act of meme-ing $pepe coin into the mindshare of fellow Twitter users. The object (meme (n.)) is $pepe. The action (meme(v.)) is the spreading of the object through various patterns, word-language, etc.</p>
            <p>To be continued…</p>
